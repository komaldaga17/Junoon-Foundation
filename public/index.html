									<sup><i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-lg"></i></sup> &nbsp;When I was in school, I wanted to do something for the society, and so did my friends. At that time, though we were eager and willing, there seemed to be too many roadblocks in our way.
								</p>
								<p class="text-justify">
									Firstly, we could not find an appropriate platform to start off. Out desire to contribute the society grew stronger as we got more and more exposed to ills of the society. Necessity being the mother of invention, our search for a platform led to forming our own social organization.
								</p>
								<p class="text-justify">
									<span>Junoon Foundation</span> was born after a lot of deliberations and discussions, which ultimately converged in a group of liked-minded youngsters. The vision, mission and goals of Junoon stem from one singular and undirectional aim: 'betterment of society through education, awareness and development'.
								</p>
								<p class="text-justify">
									As we all are aware, education is the most important thing in every walk of our life. Thus the focus of Junoon is on education. We intend to make education a joyful, meaningful and also fruitful experience for children. Education as envisaged by Junoon also encompasses creating social awareness and making the societyrealize the need for sustainable development for a better and brighter future. The sheer thought of the opportunities gets me excited and I consider it a golden opportunity to be a volunteer of Junoon.
								</p>
								<p class="text-justify">
									As a part of ourUmmid programme we used to get a residential school at Gunj every Sunday. It was overwhelming to experience the huge response from the students of the school during various activities. Ummid wasone of the best experiences of my life for the contentment it gave me on being able to contribute to the society.
								</p>
								<p class="text-justify">
									The beginiing may be humble, but if you all support our efforts, we will be able to achieve much more. I am highly obliged and thankful to Junoon for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this noble cause. &nbsp;<sup><i class="fa fa-quote-right fa-lg"></i></sup>

									<sup><i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-lg"></i></sup> &nbsp;I came across Junoon Foundation during our first collabaration projects Kreeda. We had decided to collect sports equipment by going door to soor to donate a school, an Ashram Shala, at Gunj in Wada. It being a big project, I needed a lot of help and support which was given to me by Junoon Foundation's Volunteers Onkar, Tejas, Yuvraaj and Chinmay.
								</p>
								<p class="text-justify">
									Junoon is a bunch of young people working towards achieving their ambitions in life and also trying to make the world aroud them a better place. They are a small but dynamic group of professionals, constantly working towards their goals.
								</p>
								<p class="text-justify">
									They have taken a great initiative by going to the Gunj school every sunday to conduct lectures, teach computers basics, sports, and hygiene. When we head the kids speak up so well and so confidently about various thigs, it seems that they have definitely been successful. Unlike other foundations, they avoid being "a jack of all trades and master of none", rather they believe in focusing on one place at a time. Also their intiative of launching a donation drive on the occasion of independence day was an amazing one.
								</p>
								<p class="text-justify">
									The Rotaract Club of Thabe Suburban looks forward to collabarate with the Junoon Foundation and do many such amazing projects in the future too, contributing towards their aim of empowering people through education, social upliftment and environmental awareness. I Rtr. Pooja Jadia, RTr. Akash Dhruv Singh, Rtr. Rohit Joshi and the whole of the Rotaract Club of Thane Suburban family would like to thank you for all your co-operation and support. This project would no have been so rocking without you guys. Cheeres! &nbsp;<sup><i class="fa fa-quote-right fa-lg"></i></sup>
