Home Page Design


As Home page in Junoon Foundation Includes contains three part --

1. Images
2. Mission and Vision
3. Testimonial

-------------------------------

1. Images
	
	As decided with Yuvraaj Patil and Team (Junoon's Founder), on the home page we will have the images in the landing page. And number of images decided were 5.

2. Mission and Vision

	Mission and Vision are straight forward. It will have one Vision and one Mission.

3. Testimonial

	As per design, I think of diving the Testimonial into two parts 

		1. Long Testimonial
		2. short Testimonial


So the final bean approach for the home page is give below -- 


{
	"photos":[

		{

			"name":"It Includes photo name for the alt in the list",
			"path":"It will have the path of the file"	

		},
		{

			"name":"It Includes photo name for the alt in the list",
			"path":"It will have the path of the file"

		},
		{	

			"name":"It Includes photo name for the alt in the list",
			"path":"It will have the path of the file"

		}

	],

	"missionandvision":[

		{
			"meetOurTeam":
				{
					"paragraph1":"Content of paragraph 1",
					"paragraph2":"Content of paragraph 2"
				}
			
		},
		{
			"mission":
				{
					"education":"Paragraph of education",
					"socialAwareness":"Paragraph of social awareness",
					"development":"Paragrpah for sustainable development"
				}
		}

	],
	"testimonial":[

		{
			"largeTestimonial": [],
			"smallTestimonial":[]
		}
	]
}
